#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
     O(log n) This solution is increat the input by checking with while loop 

b)
    Answer: O(log n)
        The function is  while loop was control by outer for loop. 

c)
    Answer: O(n)
        The the function is call it self is recursive function as recursive function has linear time complexity. 

## Exercise II
Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor f or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor f. Devise a strategy to determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode AND give the runtime complexity of your solution.
